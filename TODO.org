Done:
    Entity == [Component]
    Component == [Message Handler] | [Reactor]

    Messages are sent to Entities, and passed to Components (e.g. [:entity/player :event.stats/damage {:amount 40 :type :physical}] {:component/stats {...}})
    You can add middleware to components {:middleware.stats/defense (fn [entity event] (update event :defense #(- % (-> entity :component/equipment :defense)))) }
    Reactors react when an entity changes (:reactor.stats/dead? (when (zero? (:hp stats)) "dead"))
       Reactors can also be attached to a component, but listen to delta / time (Or should that be something completely different?)

* DONE Add, Remove middleware

Should we be able to add / remove middleware? Or should it always be pre-defined
and the component state should decide whether or not it's activated?
* DONE Add, Remove tickers
Add tickers. These are "handlers" that reacto to delta/time
* TODO Link - fn ; Links can be attached to handlers, to extend "generic"
Do we really need this?
